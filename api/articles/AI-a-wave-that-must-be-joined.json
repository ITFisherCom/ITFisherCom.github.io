On December 6th local time, Google CEO Sundar Pichai officially announced the launch of Gemini 1.0. I believe many people who are following closely have noticed this. When it comes to discussions on the Internet in China and abroad, it’s like two different circles. One key word is layoffs and overseas, while the other is AI.</p>\n<h2 id=\"AI-Competition\"><a href=\"#AI-Competition\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"AI Competition\"></a>AI Competition</h2><p>If you don’t pay special attention to AI, you may miss many key points. Many people think AI equals ChatGPT. What’s so interesting about a chat tool? Answering questions and searching are similar; in China, there’s Baidu’s Wenxin Yiyuan, Xiao Ai, or Siri.</p>\n<p>If you break out of the information cocoon and look far and wide, you’ll find that things have changed. Now, in the text category, indeed, ChatGPT is dominant, but there are still heavyweight products in other categories. For example, in the image category, there’s Midjourney, which can generate various images based on keywords. Baidu and Alibaba have also launched similar products, such as Alibaba’s Tongyi Wanxiang, but the effects are indeed very different.</p>\n<p>In the video category, there are products like Pika released last week and Adobe’s Firefly, which can generate interesting videos with just a keyword.</p>\n<p>AI has now expanded from pure text to images, models, and sound in all aspects. It’s not just ChatGPT dominating; it’s a comprehensive development.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Google’s-Big-Model-Gemini\"><a href=\"#Google’s-Big-Model-Gemini\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Google’s Big Model Gemini\"></a>Google’s Big Model Gemini</h2><p>Turning back to this big model, the key is multimodal. After training, Gemini 1.0 can simultaneously recognize and understand text, images, audio, etc. Therefore, it can comprehensively understand the details of information in the input and answer questions related to complex topics. Therefore, it is particularly good at reasoning about complex subjects such as mathematics and physics.</p>\n<p>Google spared no effort this year, merging Google Brain and DeepMind, finally launching this most powerful and versatile model. There were rumors in March, and it entered the “coming soon” status at the I&#x2F;O conference in May. As the saying goes, good things come to those who wait. Let’s see in January whether it’s bragging or a celebration.</p>\n","text":" Yesterday, Google’s big move arrived.
