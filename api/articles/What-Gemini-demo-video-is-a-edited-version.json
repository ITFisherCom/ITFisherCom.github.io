Tech giant Google, the parent company of Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOG), witnessed a 5.31% surge in its stock price on December 7th, reaching $136.93 per share. This marked its best performance since August 29th, pushing its total market value to $1.72 trillion. However, some analysts suspect that Google’s promotional materials for Gemini may have been exaggerated.</p>\n<p>According to Google’s released data, Gemini Ultra is touted as the first large model to outperform human experts in the Massively Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) task, achieving an impressive score of 90.0%. In comparison, human experts scored 89.8%, and GPT-4 scored 86.4%. The MMLU dataset encompasses 57 subjects, including mathematics, physics, history, law, medicine, and ethics, testing the model’s knowledge base and problem-solving capabilities.</p>\n<p>However, only the Gemini Pro version has been publicly presented, while details about the Gemini Ultra version, such as parameters, remain undisclosed. This lack of transparency has led to a perception of both grandiosity and insecurity. Shortly after Gemini’s launch on December 6th, some netizens pointed out discrepancies in Google’s promotional materials. For instance, when Google claimed Gemini’s MMLU score surpassed GPT-4, stating GPT-4’s score was 86.4%, the 60-page technical report revealed a small footnote for Gemini Ultra’s MMLU test results, mentioning the use of the “CoT@32” prompt technique, attempting 32 times and selecting the best result. In contrast, GPT-4 was evaluated without prompt words, and under this standard, Gemini Ultra’s actual test result was 83.7%, lower than GPT-4’s 86.4%. As a result, fact-checking initiatives began soon after the release of the 60-page technical report.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/20231212.webp\"></p>\n<p>In terms of multitasking comparison, pitting Gemini against GPT-4 few-shot results is an unfair assessment. It’s akin to giving Gemini a draft for a math problem, allowing it to use a calculator, while expecting GPT-4 to solve it mentally! Moreover, Gemini had 32 chances to answer, selecting the best one from 32 responses, thanks to CoT@32. If GPT-4 could speak, it might express frustration!</p>\n<p>What is the true capability of Gemini if it doesn’t cheat?</p>\n<p>HuggingFace’s Technical Lead, Philipp Schmid, created a new chart, revealing that with 5-shot testing, Gemini’s score is actually 83.7%, not 90.0%.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/20231212_2.webp\"></p>\n<p>In the realm of video understanding, Gemini demonstrates impressive capabilities, as showcased in the smooth and captivating demo videos. However, the most astonishing real-time inference effects were achieved through post-editing—addressing concerns about the smoothness and other aspects. As public opinion intensified, Google admitted to the editing of the video. Originally intended as a grand unveiling, it turned into a situation where actions spoke louder than words.</p>\n<p>In most benchmark tests, Gemini Ultra only slightly outperforms OpenAI’s GPT-4 model. In other words, Google’s best AI model made minor improvements on work completed by OpenAI at least a year ago. During the time Google has been striving to catch up with OpenAI, the latter has spent nearly a year developing its next-generation artificial intelligence model, GPT-5.</p>\n","text":"Recently, Gemini’s debut has taken the tech world by storm, seemingly outshining...","permalink":"/post/What-Gemini-demo-video-is-a-edited-version","photos":[],"count_time":{"symbolsCount":"3.3k","symbolsTime":"3 mins."},"categories":[{"name":"News","slug":"News","count":1,"path":"api/categories/News.json"}],"tags":[{"name":"IT news","slug":"IT-news","count":2,"path":"api/tags/IT-news.json"},{"name":"IT comment","slug":"IT-comment","count":2,"path":"api/tags/IT-comment.json"},{"name":"ITFisher.com","slug":"ITFisher-com","count":2,"path":"api/tags/ITFisher-com.json"},{"name":"Gemini","slug":"Gemini","count":1,"path":"api/tags/Gemini.json"}],"toc":"","author":{"name":"IT Fisher","slug":"blog-author","avatar":"/static/fisher.png","link":"/","description":"Fishing in internet information, sharing the latest IT news and AI trends","socials":{"github":"","twitter":"https://twitter.com/damonhu_x","stackoverflow":"","wechat":"","qq":"","weibo":"","zhihu":"","csdn":"","juejin":"","customs":{"book":{"icon":"https://itfisher.com/static/envelope-solid.svg","link":"mailto:hudong567@gmail.com"}}}},"mapped":true,"hidden":false,"prev_post":{},"next_post":{"title":"AI, a wave that must be joined","uid":"bc878e746b2ddaee1cd1728c6e28409d","slug":"AI-a-wave-that-must-be-joined","date":"2023-12-11T04:11:58.000Z","updated":"2023-12-11T05:08:39.130Z","comments":true,"path":"api/articles/AI-a-wave-that-must-be-joined.json","keywords":"ITFisher,information,ai,ai news,it news,IT intelligence, IT trends, IT reviews","cover":"https://itfisher.com/images/ai.png","text":" Yesterday, Google’s big move arrived.
